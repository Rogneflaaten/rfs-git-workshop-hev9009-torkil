Scripts are stored in the `./R` folder. `./data/raw-data` contains both raw-data and processed data (model outputs, summaries etc.) stored in `/data/derivedData`. `./resources` contains files used to produce references, and also the INN logo. All code creating figure 1 are located in the `./figures` folder. The `before-body.tex` file organizes the front page of the manuscript.
